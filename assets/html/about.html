                <h2>hey, what's up? hello!</h2>
                <p>I'm Eunicys Sanchez Dalumpines &#8212; a <b>SHS</b> Information Communications Technology Student at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MISTSanRafaelOfficial" target="_blank">Microlink Institute Of Science And Technology</a></p>
                <p>I have a passion for coding and playing instruments. I believe in working smart instead of working hard, in one way by applying CS Theory to make the stuffs i do easier.</p>
                <p>It all started with my early appreciation for game development in elementary and curiosity on artificial intelligence. It then got followed with some dabbling into programming in high school.</p>

                <h2>how i see my self after 10 years</h2>
                <p>After 10 years i've reached my dream job as a successful Data Scientist or a Security Analyst.</p>
                <p>And finally starting my own company and building my own research-lab facility.</p>
